### Program Overview:

- The program merges two sorted linked lists and prints the elements of the merged list.
- It reads the input test cases from standard input (console) and creates linked lists based on the input.
- After merging the lists, it prints the merged list elements separated by spaces and terminated by `-1`.
- The program then deletes the nodes of the merged list to free memory.

### Detailed Explanation:

#### `Node` Class Template:

- The `Node` class is a template for defining a node in a singly linked list.
- Each node contains two members:
  - `data`: Holds the value of the node.
  - `next`: A pointer to the next node in the list.
- The constructor initializes the `data` and `next` pointer of the node.
- The destructor is responsible for deleting the linked list nodes properly to avoid memory leaks.

#### `sort` Function:

- `sort` function merges two sorted linked lists in ascending order.
- It takes pointers to the heads of two lists (`first` and `second`).
- The function iterates through the lists and rearranges the pointers to merge them in sorted order.
- It compares the data values of nodes in both lists to maintain the sorted order.
- The merged list is returned with proper connections between nodes.

#### `sortTwoLists` Function:

- `sortTwoLists` decides which list to merge first based on the values at their heads.
- It calls the `sort` function with the lists in the appropriate order.
- Returns the merged list obtained from `sort`.

#### `main` Function:

- Reads input test cases from standard input using `getline`.
- Converts the input strings into streams for parsing.
- Parses input strings to create two linked lists (`first` and `second`).
- Calls the `sortTwoLists` function to merge the lists.
- Prints the elements of the merged list separated by spaces and terminated by `-1`.
- Deletes the nodes of the merged list to free memory using `delete`.
- The loop processes only one test case and exits using `break`.

### Program Flow:

1. Reads input test cases from standard input.
2. Converts input strings to streams for parsing.
3. Parses strings to create two linked lists (`first` and `second`).
4. Merges the lists using `sortTwoLists`.
5. Prints the elements of the merged list.
6. Deletes the nodes of the merged list to free memory.
7. Exits the loop after processing one test case.

This program efficiently merges sorted linked lists based on user input, prints the merged list, and ensures proper memory management by deleting the nodes.
