### Approach:
The code implements an efficient algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string `str`.

### Function: `string longestPalinSubstring(string str)`
This function takes a string `str` as input and returns the longest palindromic substring found within the input string.

### Variables:
- `maxLength`: Represents the length of the longest palindromic substring found.
- `start`: Stores the starting index of the longest palindromic substring.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Variables:** 
   - `maxLength` is initially set to 1 (indicating the minimum possible palindrome length).
   - `start` is set to 0 (starting index of the palindrome substring).

2. **Find Palindromes:**
   - Using a loop that iterates through each character of the string `str`, the code considers each character as the potential center of a palindrome.
   - For each character, it checks for both even and odd length palindromes around that character.

3. **Finding Even Length Palindromes:**
   - Considers each character as the center of an even-length palindrome by setting `low = i - 1` and `high = i`.
   - Expands outwards from the center while checking if the characters on both sides match.
   - Updates `maxLength` and `start` if a longer palindrome is found.

4. **Finding Odd Length Palindromes:**
   - Considers each character as the center of an odd-length palindrome by setting `low = i - 1` and `high = i + 1`.
   - Expands outwards similarly to find odd-length palindromes.
   - Updates `maxLength` and `start` if a longer palindrome is found.

5. **Return Result:**
   - If no palindrome is found (i.e., `maxLength` remains 1), it returns the first character of the input string as the "longest palindrome."
   - Otherwise, it returns the substring of `str` starting from the `start` index and having a length of `maxLength`, which represents the longest palindromic substring found.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm's time complexity is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input string. This is because the algorithm iterates through each character and expands outwards to find palindromes.
- **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space (O(1)) for variables and substrings, meeting the requirement of O(1) space complexity.

This algorithm efficiently finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string by utilizing an approach that considers both even and odd length palindromes centered at each character.
