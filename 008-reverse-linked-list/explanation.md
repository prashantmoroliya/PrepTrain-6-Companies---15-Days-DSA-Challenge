### Approach:

The iterative approach to reverse a linked list involves traversing through the original list and reversing the pointers of each node to change the direction of the list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

#### Function Signature:

```cpp
template <typename T>
LinkedListNode<T>* reverseLinkedList(LinkedListNode<T> *head)
```

This function takes the head of the linked list as input and returns the new head of the reversed list.

#### Iterative Reversal:

1. **Initialization:**

    ```cpp
    LinkedListNode<T> *prev = nullptr;
    LinkedListNode<T> *current = head;
    LinkedListNode<T> *next = nullptr;
    ```

    - `prev`: Initially set to `nullptr` as it will become the new head of the reversed list.
    - `current`: Points to the head of the original list.
    - `next`: Used to keep track of the next node before altering the `current` node's `next` pointer.

2. **Iterate through the List:**

    ```cpp
    while (current != nullptr) {
        next = current->next;
        current->next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    ```

    - `next = current->next`: Store the next node of the original list to avoid losing its reference after modifying `current`.
    - `current->next = prev`: Reverse the `current` node's pointer to point back to the previous node instead of the next node.
    - Move `prev`, `current`, and `next` pointers to the next nodes to continue the traversal.

3. **Return the Reversed Head:**

    ```cpp
    return prev; // new head of the reversed list
    ```

    - Once the loop completes, `prev` points to the last node of the original list, which becomes the new head of the reversed list. Return `prev`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
    - The solution traverses the entire list once, where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
    - The space used is constant as only a few extra pointers (`prev`, `current`, `next`) are used, regardless of the input size.

This iterative approach reverses the linked list in-place without utilizing additional space, meeting the time and space complexity requirements specified in the problem statement.
