The solution tackles the problem of finding the maximum area of a submatrix containing all 1s within a given binary matrix. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Approach:
1. The function `maximalAreaOfSubMatrixOfAll1` takes the input matrix `mat` along with its dimensions `n` (number of rows) and `m` (number of columns).

2. For each row in the matrix, the algorithm treats each row as a histogram and computes the maximum area of a rectangle within this row where all elements are 1.

3. It iterates through each row, updating the histogram height for each column. For every cell containing a '1', the respective height in the histogram is incremented. If the cell contains '0', the height is reset to 0.

4. Using a stack-based approach, the algorithm calculates the maximum area of a rectangle for each histogram (row) by considering the largest rectangle within the histogram. It uses a stack to keep track of indices.

5. Within each row:
   - It initializes a stack and traverses each element of the histogram.
   - If the stack is empty or the current element's height is greater than or equal to the height of the element at the top of the stack, it pushes the current element's index onto the stack.
   - If the current element's height is smaller than the height of the element at the top of the stack, it calculates the area of the rectangle with the top element's height as the smallest height. It pops the top element and calculates the width of the rectangle.
   - It continues this process, calculating the maximum area of the rectangle until the end of the histogram.

6. After processing each row, it updates `maxArea` with the maximum area encountered so far.

7. The loop continues for all rows in the matrix, and finally, the function returns the maximum area found among all rows.

### Main Function:
- The `main()` function reads the number of test cases `T`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the matrix and the matrix itself.
- It calls the `maximalAreaOfSubMatrixOfAll1` function passing the matrix and its dimensions, then prints the resulting maximum area for each test case.

This solution employs a histogram-based approach to solve the problem efficiently for each row in the matrix, ultimately providing the maximum area of the submatrix consisting entirely of 1s.
