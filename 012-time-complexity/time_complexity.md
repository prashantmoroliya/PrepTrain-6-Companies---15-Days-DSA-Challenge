# Time Complexity

**Problem Statement**

### Question:

What are the time complexities of finding the 6th element from the beginning and 6th element from the end in a singly linked list? Let \(n\) be the number of nodes in the linked list. Assume \(n > 7\).

### Options:

1. O(1) and O(n)
2. O(n) and O(n)
3. O(1) and O(1)
4. O(n) and O(1)

Choose one correct answer from the options above.


<!-- Answer: -->

### Answer: 

1. **O(1) and O(n)**


### Explanation:

The time complexities of finding the 6th element from the beginning and the 6th element from the end in a singly linked list, considering \(n\) as the number of nodes and assuming \(n > 7\), are:

- Finding the 6th element from the beginning: **O(1)**
- Finding the 6th element from the end: **O(n)**

So, the correct option is: **O(1) and O(n)**
