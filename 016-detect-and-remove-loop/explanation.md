# This C++ solution is designed to detect and remove a loop within a singly linked list. Let's break down the solution step by step:

### Explanation of the Solution:

#### Node Class:
- `Node` class is defined to represent each node in the linked list. It contains two attributes: `data` to hold the value and `next` as a pointer to the next node.

#### Detecting a Loop:
- `detectLoop` function implements Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. It uses two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initialized to the `head` of the linked list.
- `slow` moves one step at a time, while `fast` moves two steps at a time.
- If there's a loop, these pointers will meet at some point within the loop. If `slow` and `fast` pointers meet, it returns the meeting point; otherwise, it returns NULL indicating no loop.

#### Counting Nodes in a Loop:
- `countNodesInLoop` function calculates the number of nodes in a loop. It starts from a given `loopNode` (the meeting point detected earlier) and traverses the loop to count the nodes.

#### Removing a Loop:
- `removeLoop` function first detects the loop using `detectLoop`.
- If a loop is found, it gets the meeting point and calculates the length of the loop using `countNodesInLoop`.
- It then uses two pointers, `ptr1` and `ptr2`, initialized to `head` and the meeting point, respectively.
- `ptr2` is moved ahead by the length of the loop.
- Both pointers are moved simultaneously until they meet at the start of the loop. The meeting point becomes the start of the loop.
- It traverses the loop one more time to find the last node of the loop and breaks the loop by setting its `next` pointer to NULL.

#### Input and Output:
- The `main` function reads input for the number of nodes in the linked list (`n`), the value of `k`, and the values for each node of the linked list.
- It creates a linked list with a loop at the `k`th node, if specified.
- The loop is then removed using the `removeLoop` function.
- Finally, the modified linked list after removing the loop is printed as output.

#### Note:
- The solution assumes that the input format specifies the number of nodes and the position where the loop is to be created.
- The output is the modified linked list after removing the loop if it existed.

This solution leverages Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm to identify loops and performs a loop removal operation on a singly linked list. Adjustments can be made to the input reading part based on specific input format requirements.
