C++ solution aims to detect and remove a loop from a singly linked list. Let's break it down step by step:

### Explanation of the Solution:

#### Node Class:
- The `Node` class represents each node in the linked list. It contains two attributes: `data` to hold the value and `next` as a pointer to the next node.

#### Detecting and Removing a Loop:
- `removeLoop` function implements Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm to detect a loop in the linked list.
- It initializes two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the `head` of the list.
- Using the slow and fast pointers, it checks for the existence of a loop. If the pointers meet (`slow == fast`), it indicates the presence of a loop.
- Upon detecting a loop, it repositions the `slow` pointer to the `head` of the list and advances both pointers (`slow` and `fast`) until they meet at the start of the loop.
- It then finds the last node of the loop by traversing until the `next` of `fast` pointer becomes equal to `slow`.
- Finally, it breaks the loop by setting the `next` pointer of the last node in the loop to NULL.

#### Input and Output:
- The `main` function reads input for the number of nodes in the linked list (`n`), the value of `k`, and the values for each node of the linked list.
- It creates a linked list with a loop at the `k`th node, if specified.
- The loop detection and removal are performed using the `removeLoop` function.
- The modified linked list after removing the loop is printed as output.

#### Note:
- The solution assumes that the input format specifies the number of nodes and the position where the loop is to be created.
- The output is the modified linked list after removing the loop if it existed.

This solution leverages Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm to identify loops and removes the loop if present in a singly linked list. Adjustments can be made to the input reading part based on specific input format requirements.
