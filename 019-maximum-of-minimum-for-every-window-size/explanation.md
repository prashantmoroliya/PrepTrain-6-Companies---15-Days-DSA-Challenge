### Problem Overview:
The task involves finding the maximum value among the minimum values of every possible window size (ranging from 1 to the size of the array) in a given array of integers.

### Approach:
The solution employs a stack-based approach to efficiently determine the next and previous smaller elements' indices for each element in the array. The algorithm follows these main steps:

1. **Finding Next Smaller Element's Index (Using Stack):**
   - A stack (`next_smaller_stack`) is used to store the indices of elements.
   - Iterate through the array in reverse, pushing elements onto the stack and updating the `next_smaller` vector, which holds the indices of the next smaller elements for each element in the array.

2. **Finding Previous Smaller Element's Index (Using Stack):**
   - Similar to step 1, another stack (`prev_smaller_stack`) is used to find the indices of the previous smaller elements.

3. **Calculating Maximum of Minimums:**
   - With the `next_smaller` and `prev_smaller` vectors populated, determine the window size for each element.
   - Update an `answer` vector with the maximum value encountered within each window size.

4. **Ensuring Correctness:**
   - Perform a backward pass through the `answer` vector to ensure each window size has the maximum value encountered so far.

### Implementation:
- The solution is implemented in C++ using standard libraries (`iostream`, `vector`, `stack`, and `limits`).
- The `maxMinWindow` function encapsulates the core logic, taking the array of integers and its size as inputs and returning the result as a vector of integers.
- The `main` function handles input reading, calls the `maxMinWindow` function for each test case, and displays the output.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(N) for iterating through the array and stack operations.
- Space Complexity: O(N) for storing vectors and stacks.

### Conclusion:
The solution efficiently finds the maximum of minimums for every window size in the array using a stack-based algorithm, providing a reliable and optimized approach to solve the problem within the specified constraints.
