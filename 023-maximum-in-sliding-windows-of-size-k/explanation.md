# Detailed report of the provided code:

        }

            dq.pop_back();
        }

        dq.push_back(i);

        if (i >= k-1) {

### Purpose:
The code is designed to find the maximum element in each sliding window of size `k` within a given array `nums`.

### Libraries:
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This line includes a comprehensive library that contains commonly used standard libraries like `<vector>`, `<deque>`, etc., along with other less commonly used ones. It's often used for competitive programming but is not recommended for regular code due to its large size and inclusion of unnecessary headers.

### Function: `slidingWindowMaximum`
#### Parameters:
- `vector<int> &nums`: Reference to the input vector containing integers.
- `int &k`: Reference to the window size.

#### Variables:
- `deque<int> dq`: A deque to store indices of elements.
- `vector<int> ans`: A vector to store the maximum elements in sliding windows.

#### Workflow:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `dq` and `ans` are initialized.
2. **Loop through the Array**:
   - Iterate through the `nums` array.
3. **Maintain Window Size**:
   - If the deque isn't empty and its front element equals `i - k`, remove front elements that are no longer in the current window.
4. **Maintain Monotonicity**:
   - While the deque isn't empty and the element at the back of the deque in `nums` is smaller than or equal to the current element `nums[i]`, remove elements from the back of the deque. This maintains a decreasing order of elements in the deque.
5. **Update Deque**:
   - Push the current index `i` to the back of the deque as it could potentially be the maximum element in a future window.
6. **Store Maximum in Window**:
   - If the index `i` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` (meaning a complete window has been traversed), add the maximum element in the current window (at the front of the deque) to the `ans` vector.
7. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the `ans` vector containing maximum elements for each window.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- The algorithm iterates through the `nums` array only once with a single loop, resulting in a time complexity of O(N), where N is the size of the input array.
- Within each iteration, the deque operations (pushing, popping) are executed, but each element is pushed and popped at most once, resulting in an amortized time complexity of O(1) for each operation.
- Hence, the overall time complexity of the algorithm remains O(N).

### Space Complexity:
- `deque<int> dq` and `vector<int> ans` both use additional space. The deque stores at most `k` elements, and the answer vector stores at most `N - k + 1` elements.
- Therefore, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(N) due to the deque and answer vector.

### Conclusion:
The code efficiently computes the maximum elements in sliding windows of size `k` within the given array `nums`. It accomplishes this task with a time complexity of O(N), utilizing a deque to maintain the necessary elements for efficient calculation.
