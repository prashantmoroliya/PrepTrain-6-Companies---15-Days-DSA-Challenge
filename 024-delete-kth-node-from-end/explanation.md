### Node Class
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node *next;
    Node() {
        this->data = 0;
        next = nullptr;
    }
    Node(int data) {
        this->data = data;
        this->next = nullptr;
    }
    Node(int data, Node* next) {
        this->data = data;
        this->next = next;
    }
};
```
- This class defines a basic node structure for a singly linked list.
- Each node contains an integer `data` and a pointer `next` pointing to the next node in the list.
- The class provides three constructors:
  - Default constructor initializes `data` to 0 and `next` to `nullptr`.
  - Constructor with an integer argument sets `data` to the given value and `next` to `nullptr`.
  - Constructor with an integer and a `Node*` argument sets `data` and `next` accordingly.

### Function: `removeKthNode`
```cpp
Node* removeKthNode(Node* head, int K) {
    Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
    while(K--) fast = fast->next;
    if(!fast) return head->next;
    while(fast->next){
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next;
    }
    Node *deleteNode = slow->next;
    slow->next = slow->next->next;
    delete deleteNode;
    return head;
}
```
#### Parameters:
- `Node* head`: Pointer to the head of the linked list.
- `int K`: Integer representing the position of the node to be removed from the end of the list.

#### Workflow:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Two pointers `slow` and `fast` are initialized to the head of the linked list.
2. **Move the `fast` pointer K steps ahead**:
   - The `fast` pointer is moved K steps forward in the list.
3. **Check if `fast` becomes null**:
   - If `fast` becomes `nullptr`, it means the head node is to be deleted, so return `head->next`.
4. **Move both pointers until `fast` reaches the end**:
   - Both `slow` and `fast` are moved together until `fast` reaches the end of the list.
   - This ensures that `slow` is at the node just before the node to be deleted.
5. **Remove the Kth node from the end**:
   - Save the node to be deleted in `deleteNode`.
   - Update the `next` pointer of `slow` to skip the `deleteNode`.
   - Delete `deleteNode`.
6. **Return the updated head**.

### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm traverses the linked list twice: once to reach the Kth node from the start and then to reach the node just before the Kth node from the end.
- Both traversals have a time complexity of O(K) each.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(K), where K is the input parameter representing the position of the node to be deleted from the end.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) as it uses only a constant amount of extra space for pointers.

### Conclusion:
The provided code implements a function `removeKthNode` that removes the Kth node from the end of a linked list by utilizing two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to maintain the required positions. The time complexity is linear with respect to the position of the node to be deleted from the end.
