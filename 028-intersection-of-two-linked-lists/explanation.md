The C++ code defines two functions related to linked lists: `length` and `findIntersection`. Let's break down the code:

### `length` function:
- **Input**: `Node *head` - pointer to the head of a linked list.
- **Output**: `int` - the length of the linked list.
- **Explanation**:
  - The function initializes a variable `length` to 0 to store the length of the list.
  - It uses a pointer `temp` initially pointing to the head of the list.
  - It iterates through the linked list using a `while` loop and increments `length` while moving `temp` to the next node until `temp` becomes `nullptr`, indicating the end of the list.
  - Finally, it returns the calculated length of the linked list.

### `findIntersection` function:
- **Inputs**: `Node *firstHead`, `Node *secondHead` - pointers to the heads of two linked lists.
- **Output**: `Node*` - pointer to the node where the two linked lists intersect, or `nullptr` if there's no intersection.
- **Explanation**:
  - The function calculates the lengths of both linked lists using the `length` function defined earlier.
  - It adjusts the starting points of the lists by moving `firstHead` and `secondHead` to the same start point, aligning them by the difference in lengths.
  - After aligning both lists, it iterates through both lists simultaneously by moving both pointers (`firstHead` and `secondHead`) forward until they reach the intersection point (where the nodes are the same in both lists) or both become `nullptr` (indicating no intersection).
  - Finally, it returns the pointer to the intersection node or `nullptr` if there's no intersection.

### Summary:
- The `length` function computes the length of a linked list.
- The `findIntersection` function determines the intersection point of two linked lists by aligning them and iterating through both lists until they intersect or reach the end.
- Both functions utilize pointers to traverse through the linked lists, updating the pointers until the desired condition is met, providing necessary functionality to manage linked list operations effectively.
