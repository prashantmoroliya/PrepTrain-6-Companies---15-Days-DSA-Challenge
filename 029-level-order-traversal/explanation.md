The code defines a function `getLevelOrder` that performs a level-order traversal of a binary tree and returns the traversal as a vector of integers. Let's break it down:

1. **BinaryTreeNode Class Structure**:
    - This is a templated class for a binary tree node.
    - It consists of three members: `val` to hold the node value, `left` pointing to the left child node, and `right` pointing to the right child node.
    - The constructor initializes the node's value and sets both child pointers to `NULL`.

2. **`getLevelOrder` Function**:
    - This function takes a pointer to the root of a binary tree as its argument.
    - It performs a level-order traversal of the tree using a queue.
    - Initializes an empty vector `output` to store the level-order traversal.
    - Checks if the tree is empty. If so, it returns the empty `output`.
    - Creates a queue of pointers to `BinaryTreeNode<int>` to traverse the tree level by level.
    - Pushes the root node onto the queue to start the traversal.
    - Initiates a loop that continues until the queue is empty:
        - Stores the current size of the queue in `levelSize`.
        - Within an inner loop that runs `levelSize` times:
            - Dequeues the front node `curr` from the queue.
            - Appends the value of `curr` to the `output` vector.
            - If `curr` has a left child, enqueues it into the queue.
            - If `curr` has a right child, enqueues it into the queue.
            - Decrements `levelSize`.
    - Finally, returns the `output` vector containing the level-order traversal.

The `getLevelOrder` function allows you to obtain the level-order traversal of a binary tree, starting from the root node, and returns the values in a vector in the order they were visited.
