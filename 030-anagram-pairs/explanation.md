The code is a C++ implementation of a function named `isAnagram`. Its primary objective is to determine whether two given strings (`str1` and `str2`) form an anagram pair.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Function: `bool isAnagram(string str1, string str2)`

#### Purpose:
- **Objective:** To check if two strings (`str1` and `str2`) are anagrams of each other.
- **Return Type:** `bool` - `true` if the strings are anagrams, `false` otherwise.

#### Algorithm:

1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - Utilizes a `vector<int>` named `freq` to store the frequency of characters. The vector has a size of 26 initialized with zeros, representing the lowercase English alphabet.
   
2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - **First String (`str1`):**
     - Iterates through each character `c` in `str1`.
     - Increments the frequency of the character in the `freq` vector by performing `++freq[c - 'a']`.
   
   - **Second String (`str2`):**
     - Similar to `str1`, it iterates through each character `c` in `str2`.
     - Decrements the frequency of the character in the `freq` vector by performing `--freq[c - 'a']`.
   
3. **Comparison and Anagram Check:**
   - After both strings' frequencies are calculated:
     - Loops through the elements (`i`) in the `freq` vector.
     - Checks if any character's frequency is non-zero. If so, returns `false`, indicating the strings are not anagrams.
   
4. **Final Result:**
   - If all characters' frequencies in `freq` are zero after both strings' processing, returns `true`, indicating that `str1` and `str2` are anagrams.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N + M)
  - N is the length of `str1`, and M is the length of `str2`.
  - The function traverses both strings to compute the character frequencies, which takes linear time proportional to the lengths of the strings.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant Space
  - Uses a fixed-size `freq` vector of size 26, representing the lowercase English alphabet.
  - The space occupied by the vectors remains constant and independent of the input sizes.

This code efficiently determines whether two strings are anagrams by calculating and comparing the character frequencies in linear time complexity.
