### Purpose:
The code aims to traverse a binary tree and extract the elements that are visible from the right side at each level.

### Binary Tree Node Structure:
- The code begins with a template class `BinaryTreeNode<T>` representing the structure of a binary tree node.
- Each node contains:
  - `data` of type `T` to store the node value.
  - `left` pointer pointing to the left child.
  - `right` pointer pointing to the right child.
- The constructor initializes the node with the given `data` and sets `left` and `right` pointers to `NULL`.

### Function `printRightView`:
- **Parameters**: Takes a pointer to the root node of a binary tree (`BinaryTreeNode<int>* root`).
- **Return Type**: Returns a vector of integers representing the right view elements at each level of the tree.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Initializes an empty vector `ans` to store the right view elements.
  - Checks if the root is `nullptr`. If so, returns an empty vector indicating an empty tree.
  - Uses a queue `q` to perform level order traversal.
  - Traverses the tree level by level, adding the rightmost element at each level to the `ans` vector.
  - For each level:
    - Stores the number of nodes at the current level (`n`).
    - Iterates through all nodes at the current level.
    - Dequeues the front element `temp` from the queue and checks if it's the rightmost node at the level. If yes, adds its `data` to `ans`.
    - Enqueues the left and right children of the dequeued node if they exist.
  - Returns the `ans` vector containing the right view elements of the binary tree.

### Input Format:
- The program seems to expect input for the number of test cases and the level-order representation of each tree.

### Output Format:
- The output displays the right view elements for each input tree in a separate line.

### Constraints:
- The number of test cases (`T`) lies between 1 and 100.
- The number of nodes in a tree (`N`) ranges between 1 and 10^5.
- The value of a node (`data`) ranges between -10^9 and 10^9.
- Time Limit: 1 second

### Sample Input and Output:
- The sample inputs consist of test cases containing level-order representations of binary trees.
- The output displays the right view elements of each tree as specified in the problem statement.

### Overall:
- The code efficiently employs a queue-based level-order traversal approach to extract and output the right view elements of a binary tree for multiple test cases.
