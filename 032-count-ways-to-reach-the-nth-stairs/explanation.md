### Libraries Used
- The code utilizes `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` to include most standard libraries.

### Functions:

#### 1. `multiply`
- **Purpose**: Computes the multiplication of two 2x2 matrices (`F` and `M`) with a specified modulus (`mod`).
- **Parameters**:
  - `F[2][2]` and `M[2][2]`: Matrices to be multiplied.
  - `mod`: Modulus used for the computation.
- **Logic**:
  - Performs matrix multiplication element-wise with proper modulus operation for each element.
  - Updates the matrix `F` with the resultant values.

#### 2. `power`
- **Purpose**: Implements binary matrix exponentiation for the matrix `F` raised to the power of `nStairs`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `F[2][2]`: The matrix to be exponentiated.
  - `nStairs`: Exponent value.
  - `mod`: Modulus used for the computation.
- **Logic**:
  - Base case: If `nStairs` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns.
  - Initializes a transformation matrix `M` as `{{1, 1}, {1, 0}}` - a Fibonacci transformation matrix.
  - Recursively computes `F` raised to the power of `nStairs/2` using the `power` function.
  - Performs matrix multiplication of `F` with itself using the `multiply` function.
  - If `nStairs` is odd, multiplies `F` with matrix `M`.

#### 3. `fib`
- **Purpose**: Calculates the Fibonacci number at position `nStairs`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `nStairs`: Position of the required Fibonacci number.
  - `mod`: Modulus used for the computation.
- **Logic**:
  - Initializes matrix `F` as `{{1, 1}, {1, 0}}`.
  - Base case: If `nStairs` is 0, returns 0 as the Fibonacci number at position 0 is 0.
  - Calls the `power` function to calculate `F` raised to the power of `nStairs-1`.
  - Returns the value at position (0, 0) in the matrix `F`, which is the `(nStairs+1)th` Fibonacci number.

#### 4. `countDistinctWays`
- **Purpose**: Computes the count of distinct ways to climb `nStairs`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `nStairs`: Number of stairs to climb.
- **Logic**:
  - Initializes `mod` as `1000000007`.
  - Returns the `(nStairs+1)th` Fibonacci number by calling the `fib` function.

### Explanation:
- The code efficiently uses matrix exponentiation to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
- It is based on the principle that the count of distinct ways to climb `n` stairs is equivalent to the `(n+1)th` Fibonacci number.
- The code calculates the Fibonacci number at position `(nStairs+1)` using matrix exponentiation and returns the result.

### Input Format:
- The code assumes `nStairs` is provided or input elsewhere in the program.

### Output Format:
- For each query or test case, it prints the count of distinct ways to reach the top of the stairs modulo `10^9+7`.

### Constraints:
- 1 <= `T` <= 10 (Number of test cases)
- 0 <= `N` <= 10^5 (Number of stairs)

### Summary:
- This code employs matrix exponentiation to efficiently compute the count of distinct ways to climb stairs, utilizing the Fibonacci sequence's properties.
