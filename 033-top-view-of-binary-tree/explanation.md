Code finds the top view of a binary tree by traversing its nodes level by level. Here's a breakdown of the code:

### Libraries Used
- `map`: Utilized to store the nodes based on their horizontal distance from the root node.
- `queue`: Used to perform level-order traversal.

### Data Structure and Class
- `TreeNode`: Template class representing a node in the binary tree.
    - Contains three members: `data`, `left`, and `right` pointers.
    - Constructor initializes the `data` member and sets `left` and `right` pointers to `nullptr`.

### Function `getTopView`
- **Inputs**: The root node of a binary tree.
- **Outputs**: A vector containing the elements of the top view of the given binary tree.

#### Main Process
1. **Initialization**: Initialize an empty `topView` vector to store the top view elements and a `visited` map to store nodes based on their horizontal distance.
2. **Queue Initialization**: If the root node is null, return an empty `topView`. Otherwise, create a queue (`level`) and push the root node with a horizontal distance of 0.
3. **Level-order Traversal**: While the level queue isn't empty:
    - **Processing Nodes at the Current Level**: Iterate through all the nodes at the current level.
    - **Front Node**: Get the front node of the queue and extract its horizontal distance (`hrDistance`) and the current node (`currNode`).
    - **Visited Check**: If the horizontal distance is not present in `visited`, insert the node's data into `visited`.
    - **Queue Insertions**: If there are left and right children:
        - Enqueue the left child with a horizontal distance one less than the current node.
        - Enqueue the right child with a horizontal distance one more than the current node.
    - **Level Size Update**: Decrement the level size after processing the nodes.
4. **Building Top View**: Populate the `topView` vector by iterating through the `visited` map and adding the node values in order of their horizontal distances.

### Summary
This code provides a function `getTopView` that performs a level-order traversal of a binary tree and constructs the top view by considering the nodes that are visible from the top based on their horizontal distances from the root node.
