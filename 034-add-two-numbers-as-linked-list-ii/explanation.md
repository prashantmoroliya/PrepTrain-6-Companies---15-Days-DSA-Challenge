C++ program deals with adding two numbers represented by linked lists. Let's break down its components:

### Header and Node Class
- The initial part of the code includes necessary headers and defines the structure of a Node in a linked list using a template class.

### Functions:
1. **`countDigits`**: This function calculates the number of nodes in a linked list by traversing it.

2. **`reverseList`**: It reverses the given linked list using a standard reversing algorithm.

3. **`addTwoLists`**: This function adds two numbers represented by linked lists.

### Main Logic (`addTwoLists`)
- The function `addTwoLists` adds two numbers represented by linked lists in reverse order (from the least significant digit to the most significant).
- It reverses both input linked lists for simplification.
- Then it iterates over both lists, adding corresponding digits along with a carry and updating the current node's value.
- If any carry remains after the final addition, it adds a new node at the end of the list to accommodate the carry.
- After addition, the function reverses the resultant list to restore the original order.

### Input and Output
- The main function reads input for multiple test cases.
- It reads integers representing linked list elements, separated by spaces and terminated by -1.
- It performs the addition of two numbers represented by linked lists for each test case and outputs the resulting linked list elements separated by spaces and terminated by -1.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of the two input linked lists.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the space used is not proportional to the input size.

This program handles addition of numbers represented by linked lists efficiently and accurately by treating the lists as reversed representations of the numbers.
