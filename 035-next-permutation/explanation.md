C++ code implements the "next permutation" algorithm, generating the lexicographically next greater permutation of a sequence, or the smallest permutation if the sequence is already in decreasing order.

### Function:
- **`nextPermutation`**: This function calculates the next lexicographically greater permutation of the given permutation vector.
    - It iterates through the permutation from right to left to find the first element that is smaller than the one on its right, identifying the swapping position.
    - It then searches for the smallest element on the right side of the identified element that is greater than the element to be swapped. After finding this element, it performs the swap.
    - Finally, it reverses the elements to the right of the swapped element to create the smallest lexicographically larger permutation.

### Input and Output:
- The function takes a vector `permutation` and an integer `n` as input.
- It modifies the given permutation vector in place to produce the next lexicographically greater permutation.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N represents the size of the permutation. The algorithm involves traversing the permutation elements a constant number of times, making the time complexity linear.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the algorithm modifies the given permutation in place without using any additional space proportional to the input size.

### Summary:
This function efficiently generates the next lexicographically greater permutation of a sequence, or the smallest permutation if the sequence is already the largest possible. It's a useful tool for various combinatorial problems and is widely used in algorithms dealing with permutations.
