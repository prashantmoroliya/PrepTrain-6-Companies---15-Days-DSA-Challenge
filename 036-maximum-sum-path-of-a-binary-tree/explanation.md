Detailed breakdown of the code:

```cpp
int currentPathSum(BinaryTreeNode<int> *currentPeak, int &maxSum) {
    if (currentPeak == NULL) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Calculate the maximum path sum in the left and right subtrees
    int maxPathSumLeft = max(currentPathSum(currentPeak->left, maxSum), 0);
    int maxPathSumRight = max(currentPathSum(currentPeak->right, maxSum), 0);

    // Calculate the sum of the path through the current node
    int currentSum = maxPathSumLeft + maxPathSumRight + (currentPeak->data);

    // Update the overall maximum sum if the currentSum is greater
    maxSum = max(currentSum, maxSum);

    // Return the maximum path sum achievable starting from the current node
    return max(maxPathSumLeft, maxPathSumRight) + (currentPeak->data);
}

int maxPathSum(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;

    // Call the helper function to find the maximum path sum recursively
    currentPathSum(root, maxSum);

    // Return the overall maximum sum found
    return maxSum;
}
```

### `currentPathSum` Function:
- **Parameters**: `currentPeak` represents the current node being processed, `maxSum` is a reference variable storing the maximum sum found so far.
- **Functionality**:
  - If the current node is `NULL`, return `0`.
  - Recursively calculates the maximum path sum in the left and right subtrees (`maxPathSumLeft` and `maxPathSumRight`).
  - Computes the sum of the path through the current node (`currentSum`).
  - Updates the `maxSum` if the `currentSum` is greater.
  - Returns the maximum path sum achievable starting from the current node.

### `maxPathSum` Function:
- **Parameter**: `root` represents the root node of the binary tree.
- **Functionality**:
  - Initializes `maxSum` to `INT_MIN`.
  - Calls `currentPathSum` to find the maximum path sum recursively starting from the `root`.
  - Returns the overall maximum sum found in the tree.

This code efficiently finds the maximum sum of a path between any two nodes of the given tree using a bottom-up approach in a single pass through the tree.
