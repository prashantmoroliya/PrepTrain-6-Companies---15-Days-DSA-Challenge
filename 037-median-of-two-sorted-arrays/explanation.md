### Purpose:
The `median` function computes the median of two sorted arrays `a` and `b` in logarithmic time complexity.

### Code Logic:
- The function starts by ensuring `a` is the smaller array between `a` and `b`.
- It then initializes variables to track sizes of arrays `a` and `b` and sets initial pointers for binary search (`low` and `high`).
- The binary search loop iterates until the pointers converge (`low <= high`).
- Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoints and partitions based on the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`.
- It finds the maximum element (`leftMax`) on the left side of the partition and the minimum element (`rightMin`) on the right side.
- If the `leftMax` is less than or equal to `rightMin`, it calculates the median based on whether the total elements in both arrays are odd or even and returns the result.
- Otherwise, it adjusts the pointers based on the comparison between `a[mid]` and `leftMax`.

### Input Handling:
- The function expects two vectors `a` and `b`, representing two sorted arrays.

### Output:
- It returns the calculated median of the combined arrays or -1 if no median is found.

### Efficiency:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log(min(n, m))), where n and m are the sizes of the input arrays.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the function uses only a few extra variables for computation.

### Error Handling:
- The code assumes valid input and sorted arrays; no explicit error handling is implemented.

### Sample Use Case:
- The function is useful for quickly finding the median of two sorted arrays, which can be applicable in various algorithmic problems.
