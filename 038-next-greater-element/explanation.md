C++ code aims to find the next greater element for each element in an array. Let's break it down step by step:

### Code Explanation:

1. **Function `nextGreaterElement`:**
   - Receives a vector of integers `arr` and its size `n`.
   - Initializes an empty vector `ans` of size `n` to store the next greater element for each element in the array.
   - Declares an empty stack `s` to keep track of the elements for finding the next greater element.

2. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - It iterates through the array `arr` from right to left.
   - While traversing, it checks the stack `s` to find the next greater element.
   - If the stack isn't empty and the current element (`arr[i]`) is greater than or equal to the top element of the stack (`s.top()`), it pops the stack until it finds an element smaller than `arr[i]`.
   - If the stack is empty after the check, there's no greater element to the right; hence, it assigns `-1` to `ans[i]`.
   - Otherwise, the top of the stack is the next greater element, and it assigns it to `ans[i]`.
   - Pushes the current element (`arr[i]`) onto the stack `s`.

3. **Returns the `ans` vector**, containing the next greater elements for each element in the input array.

### Function Logic:

- The code is based on the concept of a **stack-based approach** to find the next greater element for each element in the array.
- It utilizes the property of the stack to keep track of elements in decreasing order. When an element smaller than the current one is encountered, the larger element is pushed into the answer array at the correct index.

### Efficiency:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because it processes each element in the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** It uses additional space for the answer array and the stack, which results in a space complexity of O(n).

### Summary:

This code employs a stack-based approach to efficiently find the next greater element for each element in the input array, providing a space-efficient and linear time complexity solution.
