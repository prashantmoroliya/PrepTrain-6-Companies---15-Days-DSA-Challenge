This function aims to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array using dynamic programming and binary search techniques.

### Function Overview:
- **Input**: `arr[]` - the array of integers, `n` - the size of the array.
- **Output**: Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

### Code Explanation:
- `dp[]` array: Represents the current LIS ending at different positions.
- `ans`: Tracks the length of the LIS found.
- For each element `arr[i]` in the array:
  - `position = lower_bound(dp, dp+ans, arr[i])-dp;`: Finds the position where `arr[i]` could be placed in `dp[]` to maintain the increasing order.
  - `dp[position] = arr[i];`: Updates the `dp[]` array.
  - If `position` equals `ans`, it means a new element has been added to extend the LIS, so `ans` is incremented.
- Returns `ans`, representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this function is `O(N * logN)`, where `N` is the size of the array.
- The loop runs for each element in the array, and the binary search in each iteration has a complexity of `logN`.
- Therefore, overall, the function has a complexity of `O(N * logN)` due to the binary search.

### Space Complexity:
- The function utilizes an additional space of `O(N)` for the `dp[]` array.

### Use Cases:
- It efficiently finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array, providing a crucial metric for sequence-related problems, such as finding a specific pattern, sequence compression, etc.
