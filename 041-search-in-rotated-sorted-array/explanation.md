### Function Overview:
This code implements a search algorithm to find a target integer in a rotated sorted array. It utilizes a modified binary search to handle the rotated nature of the array efficiently.

### Approach:
- **Start and End Pointers**: Initialized to the start and end indices of the array.
- **Binary Search in Rotated Sorted Array**:
  - The function performs a modified binary search.
  - At each step, it checks if the middle element (`arr[mid]`) is equal to the target (`key`).
  - If found, it returns the index (`mid`) of the element.
  - Otherwise, it performs additional checks:
    - It examines whether the array is sorted in the left half (`arr[start] <= arr[mid]`).
    - If the left half is sorted, it checks if the `key` falls within the sorted range.
    - Based on this comparison, it adjusts the pointers (`start` and `end`) to focus on the sorted part of the array for the next search.
    - If the left half is not sorted, it similarly checks the sorted portion of the right half and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
- The loop continues until the `start` pointer exceeds the `end` pointer.
- If the target integer is not found, it returns `-1`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(log N)`, where `N` is the size of the input array.
- The algorithm reduces the search range by half in each step, akin to a typical binary search.

### Space Complexity:
- The function uses a constant amount of extra space, resulting in a space complexity of `O(1)`.

### Use Cases:
- This search algorithm is effective for finding an element in a rotated sorted array, commonly used in situations where a sorted array is rotated at some pivot point, and efficient search functionality is required despite the rotation.
