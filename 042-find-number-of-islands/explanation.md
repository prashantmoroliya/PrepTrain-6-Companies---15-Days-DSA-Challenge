Code seems to be implementing a solution to find the number of islands in a given 2D grid. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

### Code Structure
- The code defines two helper arrays `dX[]` and `dY[]` representing the relative x and y coordinates around a cell to traverse in 8 directions.
- The function `getTotalIslandHelper` is a recursive function that traverses through the grid using Depth-First Search (DFS) to mark islands.
- The function `getTotalIslands` initiates the island counting process by looping through the entire grid.

### Functions
#### `getTotalIslandHelper`
- **Parameters**:
    - `mat`: The 2D matrix representing the grid.
    - `n`, `m`: The dimensions of the grid.
    - `x`, `y`: Current cell coordinates in the grid.

- **Functionality**:
    - This function checks if the cell at coordinates `(x, y)` is within bounds, is land (`mat[x][y] == 1`), and is not visited (`!vis[x][y]`).
    - If these conditions are met, it marks the cell as visited and recursively explores its neighboring cells in all eight directions using DFS.

#### `getTotalIslands`
- **Parameters**:
    - `arr`: The 2D array representing the grid.
    - `n`, `m`: The dimensions of the grid.

- **Functionality**:
    - Initializes a 2D boolean vector `vis` to keep track of visited cells.
    - Loops through the entire grid and, for each unvisited land cell (`arr[i][j] == 1` and `!vis[i][j]`), increments the `islands` count and initiates DFS to mark all cells connected to it.
    - Returns the count of islands found in the grid.

### Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the solution is O(N * M), where N and M are the dimensions of the grid. This is because the algorithm traverses each cell in the grid once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(N * M) due to the additional `vis` vector to store visited cells.

Overall, this code implements an efficient algorithm using DFS to count the number of islands present in a 2D grid.
